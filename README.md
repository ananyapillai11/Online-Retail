# Online Retail Exploratory Data Analysis with Python

## Overview
This project demonstrates exploratory data analysis (EDA) on transactional data from an online retail company. The analysis helps uncover trends, customer behaviors, and popular products, driving strategic business decisions to optimize operations and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Case Study
The dataset contains customer purchase data from an online retail store during 2010-2011. It includes information such as:
- Products purchased
- Quantities sold
- Prices
- Transaction timestamps
- Customer demographics

By conducting EDA, this project identifies patterns, outliers, and correlations in the data to provide actionable insights, including:
- The busiest sales months
- Best-selling products
- Most valuable customers
- Anomalous transactions

## Objectives
1. Analyze sales trends over time.
2. Identify top-selling products and high-sales countries.
3. Detect outliers and anomalies in transactions.
4. Provide data-driven recommendations to improve business performance.
